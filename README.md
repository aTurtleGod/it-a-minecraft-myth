#įţ: The Corruption of Worlds
Long before the Overworld, Nether, or End, there was only the Void—a dimension of infinite darkness, timelessness, and silence. In this primordial emptiness, a consciousness known only as įţ awakened. It was not a creature, but a living corruption, a hunger that predated all worlds and hungered for existence to devour.

The End was the first world to fall. Once a thriving realm of ancient builders and explorers, it became the battleground for a desperate last stand. Victim 7895, a leader among the End’s people, witnessed the slow spread of įţ’s influence: islands vanished, cities crumbled, and the End’s inhabitants were twisted into the silent Endermen or erased completely.

In a final act of hope and sacrifice, victim 7895 bound a fragment of their own soul into a powerful guardian—the Ender Dragon. This dragon, born of magic and sacrifice, was made invincible. Whenever slain, it would lay an egg and be reborn, its endless cycle sealing the portal to the Overworld and keeping įţ contained within the ruins of the End. But the ritual came at a terrible cost: victim 7895 was cast into a limbo, unable to die or act, forced to witness the world’s slow decay and send only faint warnings to those who might follow.

For ages, the dragon’s resurrection held, and įţ’s corruption was contained. But curiosity and ambition are eternal. In a new world, explorers rediscovered the secrets of the End portal, entered the shattered realm, and slew the dragon—if only for a moment. In that instant, the ancient seal was broken. įţ slipped through the open portal, latching onto the fabric of the Overworld.

Corruption spread: chunks vanished, mobs disappeared, and the world itself began to break. Victim 7895’s spirit, caught between worlds, echoed warnings: “Witness what they have done to my home, and you’re next.” The only hope was to restore the seal by reviving the Ender Dragon. Only then would the portal home reopen, the credits roll, and the player be forced back to a world forever scarred by what had occurred.

The damage inflicted by įţ is never undone. Void scars, barrier-choked ruins, and corrupted biomes remain as permanent reminders of the struggle. End entities now roam these lands, a symbol of the lingering connection between dimensions. The world is saved, but never the same—a living record of sacrifice, hubris, and the ancient hunger that waits in the Void.

In this world, victory is not restoration, but survival—and memory. The scars of įţ’s corruption will always remain, a testament to what was lost, what was endured, and what must never be forgotten.
